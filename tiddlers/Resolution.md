RESOLUTION

resolution describes the ability to distinguish small details of an object elements, 
	 
Image resolution is the detail an image holds. The term applies to raster digital images, film images, and other types of images. Higher resolution means more registered image detail.
	
Measurability:

For analogue light sensitive material: 
Measurement units: lines per millimeter
visual analysis of resolution test chart image

For digital sensors: 
Measurement units - ?
combination of light sensitive registration interface ability to report output smallest step within 0-5V and analogue digital converter board (ADC) bit rate. 

Resolution indication for both analogue and digital systems depends on many factors, including processing conditions, chosen level of light sensitivity, noise or grain structure level related to creative exposure mode




optical resolution (resolving power) is the ability of an optical device to separate (i.e., to see as distinct) elements of an object that are located in focus plane of an optical device.

Measurability:

Visual: 
Measurement units: lines per millimeter
visual analysis of resolution test chart projection image 

Numeric (MTF, OTF, Inteferometer, colimator: 
Measurement units: lines per millimeter
combination of light sensitive registration interface ability to report output smallest step and analogue digital converter board (ADC) bit rate. 

Resolution is a complex parameter related to conditions of use, combination of lens settings, especially T-stop. 

We may recommend triplet-measurement approach for projection analysis, when lens resolution has to be indicated on a distance specified for each focal length, and 3 modes: full opening, T5.6 and full closed.

It will be exciting to establish resolution reduction factor for optical attachments / tools related to all lens and focal distances. It will be clear indication of a tool quality and clear user warning on set.

resolution 

A heavily overloaded term that, strictly speaking, refers to spatial or temporal properties of a bandlimited continuous analog signal or its sampled digital representation: 

1 Generally, a measure of the ability of an imaging system or component, or of human vision, to delineate picture detail. 

2 In image science, horizontal resolution in cycles per picture width [C/PW] is the maximum number of line pairs (where each “pair” comprises a black line and a white line) that can be discriminated from a test chart containing vertically disposed alternating black and white lines (square wave). 

3 In image science, vertical resolution in cycles per picture height [C/PH] is the maximum number of cycles that can be visually discriminated per picture height from a test chart containing horizontally disposed alternating black and white lines. 

4 Traditionally, in analog video, if unqualified by horizontal or vertical, horizontal resolution: twice the number of vertical black and white pairs (cycles) that can be discerned across a horizontal distance equal to the picture height, expressed in TVL/PH or colloquially, “TV lines”. 

5 In computing, resolution usually refers to pixel count, the count of image columns and image rows of a device or an image (that is, the number or columns and rows in the pixel array), without regard to the amount of picture detail carried or displayed. 

6 Often improperly used to express what is properly called sample density, for example in “dots per inch” [dpi]. 

7 In digital cameras, resolution may refer to sensel count, the count of columns and rows of a sensor (that is, the number or columns and rows in the photosite array), without regard to the amount of picture detail carried or displayed. 

8 Often improperly used to refer to the number of quantization levels (or bits per sample). 


Tamaras / ARRIs definition:
Spatial resolution
The maximum spatial resolution is the smallest detail a camera can resolve. It’s usually measured as line pairs per millimeter or line pairs per image height. In an optical system the modulation gradually diminishes with increasing resolution. The digital sensor, however, sets an upper limit for the maximum resolution: one needs at least two sensels for a line pair. Because of the demosaicking, though, it’s not guaranteed if this will result in a recognizable line pair in the color image.

Sharpness
Sharpness is both a physical and a perceptional quantity. The physical quantity is measured as modulation transfer curve (MTF). Interestingly, there is no easy relationship between the MTF and the perceived sharpness of an image.



Pawel:
Resolution (limit) is a spatial frequency at which the contrast reaches 0%
