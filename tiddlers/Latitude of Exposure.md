LATITUDE OF EXPOSURE.

Comments fro Aleksej Berkovic, dated 05.06.2020


This term should be distinct from time of frame exposure and dynamic range. 

Confusion comes from the fact that terms “Exposure” and “Latitude” are in use for many other different meanings.

Definition of the term:
Choice of a shooting parameters balance according to creative vision / desired look of acquired footage 
Parameters involved:
Sensor settings (sensitivity)
Recording format / Encoding parameters
Mode of exposure
White balance
LUTs 
Speed of shooting
Shutter settings
Iris settings
Choice of camera filters
Choice of lens

It is not measurable parameter but universal creative term based on a major choice of parameters by cinematographer, DIT, colorist for establishing workflow corridor suitable for delivery of desired look, style and parameters of acquired image.

Drafts of possible term*:
Creative Range of Exposure (David) (!)
Exponometric range (Alekesej)(??)
Exponometric latitude (Alekesej) (??)
Exponometric ballance (Alekesej) (!)
Exposure gamut (Alekesej) (???)

After mail exchange with everyone as per message of Alfonso Parra I would also add another possible version as 2 separated terms:

Latitude – range optical densities of light sensitive material as an adequate response to exposure values range between shoulder and toe (under and over exposure areas) of characteristic (sensitometry) curve. 

Creative exposure decision – choice of shooting parameters balance suitable for particular image character acquisition according to creative vision of cinematographer and deliverables requirements.

*All versions from all ITC members should be add on to the lit of possible options for further brain storming and creation of “short list” for discussion with all Associations/Guilds members for final decision.
