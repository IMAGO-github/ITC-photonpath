        In this document I am going to make a development of the terms that have to do with the dynamic range and the latitude of exposure. These are my comments.

Dynamic range “is used in engineering to define the ratio between the largest and the smallest quantity under consideration.” 
(High Dynamic range video book) Written by Karol Myszkowski, Rafal Mantiuk, Grzegorz Krawczyk

Dynamic range (of a signal) the difference, over a given period of time, between maximum and minimum signal levels, expressed in decibels 
Note – The minimum signal level must be greater than a specified usable signal level
(IEC Internacional Electotechnical Commision)

In the images 

Dynamic range ratio of the maximum exposure level that provides a pixel value below the highlight clipping value to the minimum exposure level that can be captured with an incremental signal-to-temporal-noise ratio of at least 1, as determined in accordance with ISO 15739
DR = Lsat/Lmin
where Lsat is the saturation luminance (we take the luminance where pixel level = 0.995 of saturation), and Lmin is the luminance where SNR = 1.
(Imatest definition)

Dynamic range difference, in decibels, between the overload level and the minimum signal level (usually fixed by one or more of the noise levels, low-level distortion, interference or resolution level) in a system or sensor
ISO 12716:2001

There are several ways to measure dynamic range depending on its applications.

“The Signal noise ratio (SNR) is most often used to express the dynamic range of a digital camera. In this context, it is usually measured as the ratio of the intensity that saturates the image sensor to the minimum intensity that can be observed above the noise level of the sensor. It is expressed in decibel (db) using 20 times base-10 logaritm”

“The contrast ratio is a measure used in display system and defines the ratio between the luminance of the brightest color it can produce (white) and the darkest (black)

The contrast ratio of a scene measures the ratio of the maximum brightness of the scene to the darkest zone.
In (High Dynamic range video book) define “The Log exposure range is a measure commonly adopted in high dynamic range imaging to measure the dynamic range of scenes. Here the considered ratio is between the brightest and the darkest parts of a scene given in Luminance. The log exposure range is specified in orders of magnitude which permits the expressions of such ratios in a concise form using the logarithm base 10.”

“The exposure latitude is defined as the luminance range the film (digital?) can capture minus the luminance range of the photographer scene and is expressed using logarithm base 2.”




Definition of the term:
Choice of a shooting parameters balance according to creative vision / desired look of acquired footage 
Parameters involved: (I would divide it into two categories)

MORE TECHNICS
MORE CREATIVE
- Sensor:
             DR: Relation between noise floor and saturation of pixel.
             Sensitivity
             Dark noise
- A/D Conversor
- Gamma Curve
- Recording format / Encoding parameters
- Fps
- Shutter settings
- Display settings



- Mode of exposure
- White balance and color Space
- LUTs 
- Iris settings
- Choice of camera filters
- Choice of lens

Note: It is clear that all the parameters are related to each other

All manufacturers use the term dynamic range with the exception of Arri, Canon and Sony, the first one uses in my opinion a term that is not technically correct in either the digital or analog world. I would invite them to change it for Dynamic Range. Canon only uses the term SNR which is a bit strange to cinematographers at the moment, so I would invite them to include the term Dynamic Range.
Sony uses the term latitude in some way I think to congratulate cinematographers who come from the analog world, but would invite them to change it to Dynamic Range.

My Conclusions:

1-Manufacturers use exposure latitude, dynamic range and latitude interchangeably as if it were the same concept.

2- Cinematographers use the terms dynamic range, latitude and latitude exposure interchangeably as if it were the same thing.

3- I believe that manufacturers should give the two values, the Dynamic Range and the SNR value to their base ISO. The SNR ratio is also a way to know the dynamic range of the camera considering which is the limit where noise masks detail and texture in relation to loss of detail and texture in highlights before clipping. Sort of like an Effective Dynamic Range.

4- I would propose to definitively extend the use of the term Dynamic Range among manufacturers, as well as giving the two values ​​RD and SNR, one in Db and the other in Stop, something that Redone do.

5- We define the dynamic range of the total set of the Camera System: sensor, A / D converter, electronic processes, compression, lens, etc.

6- Dynamic range and latitude are the same concept, the first applied to the digital and electronic world, the second traditionally applied to analog emulsions.

7- In the electronic / digital world the appropriate technical term is Dynamic Range and not Latitude. Cinematographic cameras are all electronic, and their designers are engineers, not chemists.

8- According to point 7, the term SNR must be included to have more precise information on the dynamic range of the camera.
